  <sub><sup>Project Title: Simulation of Quadruped-robot Locomotion</sup></sub>
</h1>

# Week 1

**Date:** 31 Jan

**Supervisor:** Dr Murat Uney

**Student Names / Attendees:**
1. Minghong Xu
2. Zehao Ye
3. Kai Yang
4. Zepeng Pang

## Summary of Week’s Activities
At the Supervisor meeting on Monday of the first week, the group determined that the task of the first week was to complete the construction of the robot simulation environment for each member. With Minghong's help, the rest of the team successfully completed the construction of the pybullet simulation environment and other preparations on Thursday. Additionally we preliminarily explored the application of pybullet in robot motion simulation.
## Problem, Issues and Concerns
Group members need to be more familiar with how to use pybullet in the simulation of robot motion. Project schedule has started to lag behind expectations. 
## Tasks for Next Week / Actions for next meeting
Investigate how to simulate robot dog movement using pybullet.
