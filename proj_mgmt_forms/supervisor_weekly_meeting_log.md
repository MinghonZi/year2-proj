  Supervisor Weekly Meeting Log<br>
  <sub><sup>Project Title: Simulation of Quadruped-robot Locomotion</sup></sub>
</h1>

# Week 1

**Date:** 31 Jan

**Supervisor:** Dr Murat Uney

**Student Names / Attendees:**
1. Minghong Xu
2. Zehao Ye
3. Kai Yang
4. Zepeng Pang

## Summary of Week’s Activities
At the Supervisor meeting on Monday, the group determined that the task of the first week was to complete the construction of the robot simulation environment for each member. With Minghong's help, the rest of the team successfully completed the construction of the pybullet simulation environment and other preparations on Thursday. In detail, we started virtual environment by using python-poetry. We also installed LaTex, Markdown and Python extensions in VSCode to be prepared for future poster, report and code work. Additionally, we configured Git and learned its basic usage. Finally we preliminarily explored the application of pybullet in robot motion simulation.
## Problem, Issues and Concerns
Group members need to be more familiar with how to use pybullet in the simulation of robot motion. The robot model required for the simulation could not be determined. Project schedule has started to lag behind expectations.
## Tasks for Next Week / Actions for next meeting
Minghong Xu:
        1) Investigate how to simulate robot dog movement using pybullet.
        2) Write the weekly blog.
Zepeng Pang:
        1) Investigate how to simulate robot dog movement using pybullet.
        2) Write the supervisor weekly meeting log.

# Week 2

**Date:** 7 Feb

**Supervisor:** Dr Murat Uney

**Student Names / Attendees:**
1. Minghong Xu
2. Zehao Ye
3. Kai Yang
4. Zepeng Pang

## Summary of Week’s Activities
At supervisor's suggestion, the group designed a gantt chart to make work arrangement clear to everyone. In the lab on Thursday, we determined the robot model to use for simulation. After importing the  model into pybullet, everyone successfully attempted to write code to simply move the model's joints. In addition, in order to write programs more conveniently, we installed the Jupyter plugin on VSCode. Finally, We studied the kinematic modeling of the legs of a quadruped robot and the attitude adjustment matrix, which is also based on kinematic.
## Problem, Issues and Concerns
It's a bit hard to understand the knowledge of kinematic modeling. Team members need to continue learning about simulating robots with pybullet.
## Tasks for Next Week / Actions for next meeting
Minghong Xu:
        1) Try to complete a simple simulated movement.
        2) Write the weekly blog.
Zepeng Pang:
        1) Try to complete a simple simulated movement.
        2) Write the supervisor weekly meeting log.
Zehao Ye:
        1) Try to complete a simple simulated movement.
Kai Yang:

# Week 3

**Date:** 14 Feb

**Supervisor:** Dr Murat Uney

**Student Names / Attendees:**
1. Minghong Xu
2. Zehao Ye
3. Kai Yang
4. Zepeng Pang

## Summary of Week’s Activities
At the supervisor meeting on Monday, The team decided to simulate three movements: pitch motion, yaw motion, and roll motion. In the knowledge of the kinematic modeling of the legs of the quadruped robot studied last week, we learned the knowledge of pitch angle, yaw angle and roll angle. The knowledge of these three angles corresponds to the three motion we want to simulate. The team decided that three people would each undertake a simulation of a motion, and the remaining one would be responsible for the paperwork which contains blog, supervisor weekly meeting log and preparation of the poster.
## Problem, Issues and Concerns
Group members need to keep learning commands and functions which would be used in pybullet. Spend more time in the last two weeks to speed up the project.
## Tasks for Next Week / Actions for next meeting
Minghong Xu:
        1) Complete the simulation of robot's roll motion.
Zehao Ye:
        1) Complete the simulation of robot's pitch motion.
Kai Yang:
        1) Complete the simulation of robot's yaw motion.
Zepeng Pang:
        1) Complete paperwork (blogs, meeting log, preparation of poster).

# Week 4

**Date:** 21 Feb

**Supervisor:** Dr Murat Uney

**Student Names / Attendees:**
1. Minghong Xu
2. Zehao Ye

## Summary of Week’s Activities
After last week's research, we successfully deduced the matrix transformation formulas of pitch, yaw and roll angles this week. On this basis, the code of pitch, yaw and roll actions was developed, and the simulation of the three actions of the quadruped robot was successfully completed. The main tasks of the project have been completed. After that, we started designing the poster and preparing for next week's bench inspection.
## Problem, Issues and Concerns
The poster has not yet been designed, which may take up our time on Saturday and Sunday. The members responsible for the paperwork may not be familiar with the code.
## Tasks for Next Week / Actions for next meeting
1. Design the poster and make it
2. Prepare documents required for bench inspection
3. Everyone in the group should be familiar with the code
