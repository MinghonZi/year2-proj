# log of week 2
***********************
## the Discussion in week 2
1. Start learning the code, understand how the quadruped robot dog walks, and debug the model movement
2. Discussed the details about the gait and motion of the quadruped robot dog, tested the amplitude of each actuator of the quadruped robot, determined the quadruped robot model we used.

## Study
1. Learned read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.

2. Learn based on MIT's work: mini cheetah code, reference their experience to write our algorithm

## summary
1. More familiar with the characteristics of the *pybullet* physical simulation platform, so that our work can be better carried out
2. Have a preliminary understanding of the walking mode of the quadruped robot
