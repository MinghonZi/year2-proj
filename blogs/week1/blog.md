# Log of week 1
During the group discussion and work in week 1, we downloaded the software to be used and configured the development environment of the project.
The purpose of this project is to use software to simulate the movement of a quadruped robot, so a suitable development environment is very important. In addition, the team members learned how to use GitHub for development collaboration, especially the git function, which will be very helpful for future work.
This is the beginning of the project, no major code parts are involved. So the first week was not very difficult.
