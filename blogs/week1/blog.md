## Study 
1. Learned how to use Github, especially the efficient way of online working with git.
2. Learned the basic operation of the pybullet platform.

## *Pybullet*, the platform we use
1. **PyBullet** is an easy-to-use Python module for physics simulation for robotics, games, visual effects, and machine learning. 
2. With PyBullet we can load articulated bodies from URDF, SDF, MJCF, and other file formats. 
3. PyBullet provides forward dynamics simulation, inverse dynamics computation, forward and inverse kinematics, collision detection, and ray intersection queries.
