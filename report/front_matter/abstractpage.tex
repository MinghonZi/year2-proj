\begin{abstract}
   This document serves as a template to show you how to present and structure your project dissertation. In the interests of uniformity of format, you are asked not to significantly alter the format and layout of this \LaTeX~ document. The chapter names and structure are intended as a guide, and you are welcome to change these as appropriate. While this is not a definitive guide to dissertation writing, it is intended as a guide to assist in documenting and presenting your project work in an academic and professional manner, and reflects the expectations of those in academia and industry who are likely to read your report. Appended to this guide are some real examples of common mistakes that should be avoided.

   Your Abstract is expected to be between 100 and 250 words in length, and should summarise the problem, outline the approach adopted, and summarise the project findings or results. It's the first (and possibly the only) part to be read, and should provide a snapshot of the whole project in 2 or 3 paragraphs.
