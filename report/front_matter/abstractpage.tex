This report first introduces the background knowledge and objective of the quadrupedal locomotion simulation project. The objective of the project is divided into four parts, corresponding to four simulations of motions, which are pitching, yawing, rolling, and squatting motion. Various software and plug-ins used in this project, such as simulation platform pybullet and VSCode editor, are introduced respectively afterwards. Then, the method of modeling the legs of a quadruped robot is explained in detail. Subsequently explained how to use trigonometry knowledge and kinematic algorithms to derive kinematic models for each motion. The report concludes by presenting the results of the project, with the simulation of all motions successfully completed. Meanwhile, we discussed intellectual property, future work, reflection, and other aspects about this project.

In addition, the code in the project, project management forms, and individual contributions of each member will be provided in the Appendix section. respectively.
